### _På vita knogar_

<br>

#### Abstract:

This thesis analyzes and explains the process and development of the project ”På vita knogar,” which explores the HTML5 featured Canvas API and its possibilities and limitations in regards to graphics generation. Originally attempting to create a result similar to a Jackson Pollock painting, encountered obstacles and imposed constraints forced the project into a new direction resulting in an art piece transcending traditional boundaries in the realm of visual arts. The paper discusses the research conducted on procedural graphics generation, Jackson Pollock's painting techniques, and color theory to provide insight into the project's development. Additionally, it presents the selection of programming languages and the underlying rationale behind their choice, along with an explanation of the emergent file structure during the development process. The paper concludes with a discussion of the final outcome, highlighting how encountered obstacles shifted the project's trajectory from its initial focus into a venture beyond the confines of the two-dimensional realm. By incorporating 3D graphics the piece transformed from its original form as a 2D painting into a dynamic 2D/3D composition that shares equal characteristics of both video and painting, thereby blurring the lines between these two mediums of expression.
