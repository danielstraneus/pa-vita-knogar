# ABBEY PARK - _Occult Hamster Society_

<br>

## Content:

A fullstack SPA utilizing Node js, Express and Google's Firestore for the backend and React with Typescript for the frontend.

The app begins on the landing page where the current supreme leader among the occult hamsters is being displayed. If several hamsters are sharing the top spot with the same high score (wins - losses) a random one among these hamsters will be displayed when the page launches.

In the app you can also navigate over to the battle view where two random occult hamsters from the database are being pulled and displayed. Here you'll have the option to vote on your favorite occult hamster and after voting see their current amount of wins, losses and games. After voting you'll have the possibility to initiate a new match and repeat the whole process over again.

There's also a gallery view where all current occult hamsters in the database are being displayed (using CSS grid). Here you can click on every hamster to access additional info such as age, favorite food + more. In this additional info view you'll also have the option to delete the selected hamster and by doing so replace it with its tombstone.

In the gallery view there's also a form where you can add new occult members to the society by typing in their name, age, favorite diet, interests and finally providing an image url. The form uses validation for the input fields and adding a new hamster to the database is only possible if all conditions are met.

on top of all this there's an occult handbook section included in a separate view in the app where you can educate yourself on all things occult.<br><br>

_Explore your light and celebrate your darkness._
